# rust_android_ios

Android/iOS app with shared Rust logic

Based on the [Rust Swig](https://github.com/Dushistov/rust_swig) Android example with added support for iOS from [rust-ios-android-example](https://github.com/terhechte/rust-ios-android-example) + upgrade and customization.

The idea is to continue evolving this. Maybe a little mobile Rust framework? It would be interesting to explore reactive (have a Rust stream propagate down to Swift UI or Jetpack compose!).

See [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq1pQ0RpstM) from [@terhechte](https://github.com/terhechte) - this started this!
